# csharp-design-patterns-study

A simple class library where I have tried to implement a design pattern in each class file, while I am studying them.
Each Class file except one contains a commented Main method.
To run a demo of any design pattern, uncomment the Main method from class file, and comment the exisitng Main method

(A good developer will know the quick way to find out which class has an uncommnetd Main method ;) )
