# csharp-design-patterns-study

This is a simple class library where I have tried to implement a design pattern in each class file, while I am studying them.
Each Class file except one contains a commented Main method, to run a demo of any design pattern, uncomment the Main method from class file, and commnet the exisitng Main method (A good developer will know the quick find out which class has an uncommnetd Main method ;) )
